    "# Vanilla Machine Learning Workflow for Credit Risk Modeling\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "The lecture introduced you to credit scoring, the problem of estimating the probability of credit applicants to repay debt. In this demo, we will explore the *probability* of default (PD)* modeling problem in more detail by going through the various stages of the machine learning process, from initial data screening and explanatory data analysis (EDA) to sophisticated predictive modeling and insightful post-hoc analysis. The purpose of this notebook is to i) give you a feeling of what a standard (supervised) ML workflow looks like and ii) how Python and selected Python libraries support us in our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of what you'll encounter in the demo:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing: We start our journey by diving into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we'll see how to use visual and statistical methods to understand our data's main characteristics. This foundational step helps us discern the story our data tells, guiding our subsequent steps. Furthermore, this step helps us to spot data quality problems, which we should fix before moving on.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Explanatory Modeling: Next, we transition into building an explanatory model, where we'll create and assess a regression model to understand the relationships within our data. This process involves not just building the model but also interpreting the results, providing us with valuable insights into the dataset's features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Predictive Modeling: Armed with insights from our explanatory model, we'll move into predictive modeling. Here, the aim shifts to creating models that can predict new outcomes based on the data. We'll employ two different approaches – a simple linear model known as *Logistic Regression* and a cutting-edge gradient boosting model called  *XGBoost*.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Post-hoc Analysis: After our models are built and evaluated, we'll delve into post-hoc analysis, dissecting the models' decisions and interpreting their significance. This stage enhances our understanding of model behavior and the importance of different features, reinforcing the concept that effective machine learning involves both prediction and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how these steps mimic the standardized ML process, which we discussed in the lecture: \n",
    "\n",
    "![A process perspective towards machine learning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Humboldt-WI/demopy/main/ml_pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we proceed, remember that this notebook isn't just a place to read code – it's an interactive environment where you can run cells, alter code, and see the results immediately. We deleted all cell outputs so that you must, at least, execute every coding cell to really experience the demo. Furthermore,  you're encouraged to play around with the codes, make mistakes, ask questions, and most importantly, enjoy the process of discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, you are going to encounter many new concepts throughout this demo, and it's completely natural to feel overwhelmed at times. You are supposed to understand every detail of what you will see. The demo is like a journey through the entire course. Future coding sessions are designed to delve into the individual components and concepts showcased here, providing a more detailed foundation and context to enhance your comprehension. This notebook is just the beginning; it's a launchpad that will propel you into the vast universe of machine learning. So, take everything in stride, stay curious, and remember, every expert was once a beginner. "

    "### Retrieve the data\n",
    "For this demo, we consider the *Home Equity (HMEQ)* data set from the textbook [Credit Risk Analytics](http://www.creditriskanalytics.net). It comprises information about a set of borrowers, which are categorized along demographic features and features concerning their business relationship with the lender. A binary target variable called 'BAD' is provided and indicates whether a borrower has repaid their debt. Here is an overview of the data:\n",
    "- BAD: the target variable, 1=default; 0=non-default\n",
    "- LOAN: amount of the loan request\n",
    "- MORTDUE: amount due on an existing mortgage\n",
    "- VALUE: value of current property\n",
    "- REASON: DebtCon=debt consolidation; HomeImp=home improvement\n",
    "- JOB: occupational categories\n",
    "- YOJ: years at present job\n",
    "- DEROG: number of major derogatory reports\n",
    "- DELINQ: number of delinquent credit lines\n",
    "- CLAGE: age of oldest credit line in months\n",
    "- NINQ: number of recent credit inquiries\n",
    "- CLNO: number of credit lines\n",
    "- DEBTINC: debt-to-income ratio\n",

    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Having loaded the data, our first task is to get an initial understanding of the data. Enter the realm of Descriptive Statistics – a powerful tool that provides a concise summary of the main characteristics of our data, offering a quick snapshot and insight without the need to delve into complex visualizations or computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our journey begins with the ```pd.DataFrame.info()``` method, a vital first step that reveals the high-level structure of our data frame. This function provides us with essential details such as the number of entries (eg, rows), the data types of each feature (ie, column), and the amount of non-null values. Understanding this information is crucial as it sets the stage for further analysis and preprocessing by giving us a clear picture of our dataset's composition, especially concerning data types and missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll harness the power of the ```pd.DataFrame.describe()``` method, a convenient `Pandas` function that computes a suite of summary statistics for each column in our dataset. Whether you're curious about the average debt-to-income ratio, the variation in loan amounts, or the largest outstanding debt on a mortgage, `describe()` offers a comprehensive overview at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why are these steps essential? Both ```info()``` and ```describe()``` help us establish a foundational understanding of our dataset's distribution, scale, and tendencies. While ```info()``` gives us a structural overview, ```describe()``` takes us a step further into the statistical nature of each column. By noting aspects like the mean, standard deviation, and various percentiles, we can swiftly detect outliers, identify patterns, and formulate hypotheses for further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these methods serve as our initial checkpoint, ensuring that we're not only aware of the dataset's composition but also intimately acquainted with its statistical properties. This knowledge is instrumental in guiding our next steps, be it data cleaning, feature selection, or exploratory analysis, as we progress further into our data exploration journey."

Whether it's histograms, scatter plots, or line charts, Matplotlib provides the functionalities to craft them all with detailed customizations.\n",

While it integrates closely with Matplotlib, Seaborn simplifies many complex visual tasks, making sophisticated plots accessible and understandable. Notably, it excels in handling and representing complex datasets and statistical models — from heatmaps to regression line plots.\n"

    "Examining the distribution of individual features can inform further data preparation steps. For example, the feature ```DEROG ```, which captures the number of major derogatory reports, is zero for most customers and non-zero for only a relatively small sample of clients. One could speculate whether it is preferable to transform the feature into a binary indicator of whether a client received one or more major derogatory reports in the past or not. This might better represent the core information that this feature embodies for predicting the target.\n",
    "Shifting attention to the feature ```LOAN ```, we can observe a *long tail* of a few clients having received loans much larger than those of what most clients lend. The same pattern is observable for the feature ```MORTDUE```. Again, features with such *right-skewed distributions* might become more useful if we apply a transformation, which could, for example, involve *[discretizing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing-discretization)* the feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we speak about the *informativeness* of a feature or how useful it is, it is important to point out that these statements refer to the focal use case. We strive to predict whether a credit application would repay a loan. In this context, a feature is useful if it helps predict applicants' repayment behavior. To obtain a clearer view, we can visualize our data as a stacked histogram, which displays the distribution of a feature for all good payers and bad payers separately. Here is how to do this.\n",

So, what is gradient boosting? At its heart, it's a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weaker prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the ensemble in a stage-wise fashion where models are added sequentially until no further improvements can be made.\n",

    "When working with more complex models like XGBoost, several parameters need fine-tuning to enhance the model's predictive performance. In the case of XGBoost, three pivotal ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree Depth**: This represents the depth of the decision trees in the ensemble. Deeper trees can capture more complex patterns by adding more decision nodes, but they also risk overfitting the training data. Conversely, shallower trees might underfit, missing crucial information.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Learning Rate**: This is a crucial hyperparameter that controls the impact of each additional tree on the final outcome in the boosting process. A smaller learning rate means the model is more robust to overfitting. However, it will train more slowly and require more trees to model all relations between features and targets. A larger learning rate leads to faster training but can overshoot the optimal point.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Number of estimators**: This denotes the number of trees you want to build. In general, a higher number of trees increases the model's performance, but after a certain point, the benefit in prediction performance becomes negligible, and it might overfit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting these parameters requires a systematic approach, and this is where grid search comes into play. Grid search is a method for hyperparameter tuning that involves constructing multiple versions of the model, each with a different combination of settings, and selecting the combination that performs the best. In simpler terms, imagine trying every spot on a grid for the best view of a landscape, rather than just guessing and checking random spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, how do we ensure that the combination selected is truly the best and not just lucky due to some quirk in the way we split our data? This brings us to k-fold Cross-Validation (CV).\n",
    "\n",
    "k-fold CV is a resampling procedure used to evaluate a model on a limited data sample. The process divides the dataset into k number of subsets (or folds) of equal size. It then iteratively trains the model k times, each time training the data on k-1 of the folds and evaluating it on the kth fold. After running these iterations, the results are averaged to provide a single estimation. The primary reason for using this method is to limit problems like overfitting or underfitting and get a sense of how the model will generalize to an independent dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we're using a 5-fold CV. This means each dataset is split into 5 parts, the model is trained on 4 parts and validated on the remaining part, iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining grid search with cross-validation provides a robust method for optimizing a model's hyperparameters. We're not only searching for the best parameters, but we're also ensuring they produce a model that generalizes well."

    "### Partial Dependence Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial Dependence Plots are a visualization tool used for exploring the relationship between a set of features and the predictions of the machine learning model while averaging out the effect of other features. These plots allow us to visualize how changes in a feature's values affect the predictions of the model, assuming that all other features remain constant. This is especially valuable when dealing with complex models like ensemble trees or neural networks, where it's not immediately clear how a model arrives at its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of PDPs extends beyond just interpretation; they help in validating whether the model's behavior aligns with domain knowledge, identifying potential areas for feature engineering, and detecting regions in the feature space where the model might underperform or be overly confident.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we're going to generate Partial Dependence Plots for our models. We'll analyze how the screen size in inches impacts our resale price predictions, providing us with deeper insights not just into our data, but also into the model's inner workings."

But how do we measure each player's contribution? That's where SHAP comes in. It uses a concept from cooperative game theory called the Shapley value to fairly distribute the \"contribution\" among the players. In other words, it tells us how much each feature in your data contributes to the model's decision; that is prediction.\n",
