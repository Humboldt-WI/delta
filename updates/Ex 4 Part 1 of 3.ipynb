As you may have noticed with neural networks, this will be impossible with all of the parameters. When conducting a first forward pass, you will choose weights usually without calculations. This sounds crazy and inefficient, but this will make sense once we move into back propagation which is where weights are optimized. Completely random initialization will not work well. To do a little better than that, we use uniformly distributed random numbers in a bounded range. In a nutshell, this is to avoid neurons getting saturated. Glorot and Bengio (2010) and some deep learning tutorials set the boundary for random numbers based on the  number of incoming and outgoing connections:\n",

Alternatively, python libraries that deal with NNs allow you to select them randomly from a random normal or random uniform distribution. Again, you'll have to experiment a bit to find out which combination works best. Back propagation will take these intial weights and begin correcting them, but of course certain combinations may cause more optimal performance. **Again, your first forward pass will likely do poorly, this is expected.**"

    "## Final Activation Function\n",
    "The final activation function is particularly important because it will determine the possible values to be output. If we have a **regression** problem, the final activation function is normally either a linear function (no activation), ReLU or leaky ReLU. These functions allow outputs of any number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid functions have an output range from 0 to 1. **If your regression output value range is fixed** (eg. percent score on a test which ranges from 0 to 100), **you can min-max scale your target before input into the neural network, use a sigmoid as activation and then inverse transform your data**. This will ensure predictions remain in the range of your data. You can also use tanh in this case as it has the same functional form but its range is between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of the most common activation functions that we can use. Note there are quite a few, but these are the most popular."
