    "Written/spoken text is unstructured data. Teaching computers to \"understand\" language has been one of the hardest tasks researchers from computer science and linguistic fields had to face. It is still work in progress but the modern methods of **natural language processing (NLP)** offer very impressive results. We need to map the semantic diversity that our brain operates in to the numeric field that computers can \"understand\". Thus, our goal is to represent a meaning of the word/sentence/text with a real-number vector. How can we do that? We use the standard pre-processing operations of the NLP workflow. Thereafter, we can apply some machine learning methods. That is pretty much the outline of today. The last part of the tutorial, however, will also introduce us to a simple form of transfer learning in NLP by using pre-trained work vectors.\n",
