    "# Exercise NLP pipeline\n",
    "You are already familiar with building predictive models on tabular data. In tabular data, you have a feature matrix `X` and a target vector `Y`. Given these data structures, you can apply learning algorithms like neural networks or random forests to learn the relationship between `X` and `Y`. In this exercise, you are provided with a data set of movie reviews. Your goal is to build a classifier predicting whether a review is positive or negative (this task is called sentiment classification). Hence, you have a prediction problem with a binary target, `Y`, which is nothing new for you. However, in this exercise, what is new for you is that you need to deal with text data instead of tabular data. With text data, you need to process the data to obtain the required feature matrix `X`. This processing of data is what we call the \"NLP pipeline\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will need to set up an NLP pipeline. You are provided with a data set of movie reviews, where each sample contains a review (just a string cell). To obtain a feature matrix, each sample string cell needs to be transformed into a feature vector $x$. This process is called vectorization. There are multiple possible vectorization procedures. Today, you will implement a bag-of-words model for feature extraction. This feature extraction process involves two steps:\n",
    "1. Vocabulary building\n",
    " * Tokenization: Transforming a review, which is a single string at the beginning, into a vector of strings (tokens).\n",
    " * Cleaning and compressing techniques: Reducing the number of distinct tokens. E.g., correcting the misspelling of words or lower casing the letters prevents the same word from appearing in multiple spelling ways. Additionally, similar words (e.g. different forms of a verb) can be united into a single token. \n",
    " * Building a bag-of-words: a vector whose length corresponds exactly to the number of different tokens. Each token is assigned the position within the vector. \n",
    " \n",
    "2. Feature creation based on term frequency: Each review gets transformed into a feature vector $x$. The length of the feature vector corresponds to the length of the bag-of-words vector, created in step 1. An element $x_{j}$ of the feature vector is calculated by a frequency measure, measuring how frequently token $j$ from the bag-of-words vector occurs in the review. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first code cells provide the required packages and load the review data set, which you will use for the exercise. In the exercise, you will build the most simple NLP pipeline, which means that you go through steps 1 and 2 of the NLP pipeline, but you skip the \"cleaning and compressing\" part of step 1. This simple NLP pipeline provides you with a feature matrix `X` (possibly not ideal). You will use this feature matrix to build and evaluate a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tutorial, we will extend your NLP pipeline by including the cleaning and compressing techniques (according techniques are also covered in detail in the demo notebook `nlp_foundations.ipynb`). That will lead to another feature matrix, `X`. Then, we will build another predictive model on this new feature matrix `X` and compare the performance to the model built by the simplified NLP pipeline."

    "e) Let's recap how feature vectors are generated from this vocabulary. The basic idea of bag-of-words based feature extraction is to generate for each token in the vocabulary a column in the feature matrix `X`. For an observation $i$ (corresponding to a single review), the entry $X_{i,j}$ of the feature matrix would be 1 if the review contains the token of column $j$ and 0 otherwise. There are some variations to this approach. The Tfidf approach (*term frequency-inverse document frequency*), which we apply in this exercise. This encodes $X_{i,j}$ not as 1 if the review contains token $j$ but as the occurrence frequency of token $j$ in the review divided by the occurrence frequency of token $j$ in the whole document (all reviews of the data set combined). Have a look at the matrix, which the `TfidfVectorizer` created. "

As a consequence, we obtained a dictionary with a lot of tokens which are most likely not so informative. The high number of tokens in the dictionary resulted in a very high dimension of the feature matrix `X`. In this exercise, we will add the cleaning and compressing part to the NLP pipeline. We hope to create a feature matrix of lower dimension, which yields more accurate predictions."
