    "# Tutorial 2: Neural Network Training\n",
    "The tutorial is meant to build some understanding of how neural networks learn relationships between features `x` and a \n",
    "target `y`. The tutorial deals with gradient descent. In the exercises, we assume that students are familiar with the general form of neural networks. Hence, the architecture of neural networks is not part of the exercises. You can find corresponding demonstrations in our [feedforward neural network demo](https://github.com/Humboldt-WI/delta/blob/master/demos/fnn/nn_foundations.ipynb). That notebook covers the architecture of neural networks and the learning procedure. Here, we only focus on the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we restrict the architecture of the neural networks to the form\n",
    "$f(x)=\\beta\\cdot sigmoid(x)$. This corresponds to a very simple neural network with linear output function, sigmoid activation, 1 hidden layer and bias (constants) forced to zero. By considering this simple neural network, the code becomes simpler, and you can (hopefully) gain a better intuition of neural network learning procedures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through further exercises covering back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent during the session."
