    "# Tutorial 5: Word embeddings and Word2Vec\n",
    "The tutorial covers word embeddings in general and one of the most well-known models in this matter, the so-called Word-to-Vec (W2V). For this purpose, we reconsider the text dataset IMDB from the last tutorial. Yet, this time we preprocess the data with `Keras` using the `TextVectorization` layer that facilitates the standardization, tokenization and indexing. Next, we create a simple binary classification model using word embeddings to grasp the essence in practice. Finally, we apply the W2V model to the same data using [Gensim library](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Several libraries make things easier if the aim is to use W2V directly. The [Gensim library](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/) is one of them that offers a friendly interface to train embeddings, as you will see in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you would like to start from scratch and code W2V yourself using just `NumPy`, we recommend [Nathan Rooy's post](https://nathanrooy.github.io/posts/2018-03-22/word2vec-from-scratch-with-python-and-numpy/). Or, if you would like to do it with `TensorFlow`, there is an excellent tutorial [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec) from the TensorFlow website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline then is the following\n",
    "1. Preparing the IMDB dataset with `Keras`\n",
    "2. Understanding embeddings with a simple binary classification model\n",
    "3. Word2Vec using `Gensim`\n",
    "\n",
